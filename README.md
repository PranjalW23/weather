- Uses AJAX (Fetch API) to retrieve data from OpenWeatherMap API.
- Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure, sunrise, sunset, and weather condition.
- Shows corresponding weather icons using symbols (e.g., ‚òÄÔ∏è for clear, üåßÔ∏è for rain, etc.).
- Includes a loading indicator while fetching data.
- Bootstrap-based responsive design.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS (Bootstrap for styling)

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser.
2. Enter a city name in the input field.
3. Click the 'Get Weather' button.
4. The weather details will be displayed on the screen.

## API Configuration
